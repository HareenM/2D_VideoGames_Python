Pong Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Pong using Python and the turtle module. The game provides a retro gaming experience with a black background and simple graphics.

Instructions
Install the required dependencies by running pip install turtle in your terminal or command prompt.

Run the Python script pong.py to start the game.

Use the following controls to play the game:

Player A (left paddle):
Move up: 'W' key
Move down: 'S' key
Player B (right paddle):
Move up: Up arrow key
Move down: Down arrow key
The objective of the game is to bounce the ball off the paddles and prevent it from going past your own paddle. Each time the ball passes your opponent's paddle, you score a point.

The game continues until you exit the window.

Features
Two-player game: Play against a friend.
Realistic ball physics: The ball bounces off the paddles and the top/bottom borders.
Score tracking: The scores of both players are displayed on the screen.
Retro-style graphics: The game has a black background and simple shapes.
Customization
You can customize the game further by modifying the code. Some possible customizations include:

Changing the size of the game window: You can adjust the width and height parameters in the wn.setup() function call.
Modifying paddle size and speed: The stretch_wid parameter in the shapesize() function call determines the height of the paddles, and the speed() function calls control the speed of the paddles.
Adding sound effects: The code currently plays a sound effect when the ball bounces off the borders. You can add more sound effects using the os.system("afplay sound.wav&") lines and providing the path to the sound file.
Adding additional features: You can extend the game by adding power-ups, different game modes, or other elements to enhance the gameplay.
Feel free to experiment with the code and make it your own!
